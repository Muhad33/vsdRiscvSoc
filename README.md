# vsdRiscvChipTapeOut
This repository contains all tasks, projects, and documentation completed as part of the Workshop on India's RISC-V Program (Cohort 2).
The objective of this initiative is to gain hands-on experience in RISC-V architecture, toolchains, simulators, and open-source design workflows â€” ultimately leading to the design, verification, and tape-out of a reference RISC-V chip using the SCL180 (180nm CMOS) process by the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), India
